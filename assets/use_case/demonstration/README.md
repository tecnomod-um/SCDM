# System demonstration

This folder contains videos demonstrating how to use the application for the following use cases:

  - [use_case_1.mp4](./use_case_1.mp4) Take patients with suffered the stroke when they were between 12 and 40 years old. From these patients, select those who improved the memory digit test from Bateria evaluation (they get a score lower than 5 first, and greater than 5 later), and show the GNPT rehabilitation tasks regarding memory training they perform in between the bateria evaluations.
  - [use_case_2.mp4](./use_case_2.mp4) Get the wrist stability assessment at admission using Fugl-Meyer evaluation of female patients. In this case, the query retrieve results from two heterogeneous datasets that were harmonized by using the SCDM, namely patients from the [Guttmann Institute](https://www.guttmann.com), and patients from the [Interdisciplinary Comprehensive Arm Rehabilitation Evaluation (ICARE)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23311856/).
